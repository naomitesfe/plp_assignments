# OOP Assignment in Python

## Activity 1: Design Your Own Class
- Created a `Smartphone` class that inherits from a `Device` base class.
- Demonstrated constructors, encapsulation, and inheritance.

## Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge
- Implemented `Car`, `Plane`, and `Boat` classes.
- All have the same method `move()` but behave differently (polymorphism).

Run with:
```bash
python smartphone.py
python polymorphism.py
```
